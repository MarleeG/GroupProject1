# WhoRepresentsYou

Our team created a simple but useful app that allowed users to select which state they wanted to localize to in order to display at least one member from the House of Representatives and the two senators according to the users selection.

## Getting Started

What does our app solve?
Find out who your representative is based on location to be more informed and active within your community.

### Test Case

Explain what these tests test and why

```
When adding animation to the frontend our team ensured that events such as hovering and clicking on icons/buttons were animated once this action occured. In order to test these actions on the icons/buttons we hovered and clicked on the items that were animated based on the user's action. To conclude the frontend tests the actions produced by the user animated the neccessary item upon the event was successful. 
To perform tests on the backend we utiziled "console.log()" for each variable along with our ajax calls to ensure the data was accurate, especially if the data depeneded on the user's actions. To make certain the backend was working in conjunction with the frontend we tested our app once we linked them to each other. Since we had two html pages with main page determining what will be shown on the next page we utilized local stoarge to display the corresponding information based on what was stored locally.
